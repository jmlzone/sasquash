This is a project for a light up bigfoot aka yeti aka sasquatch with an esp8266 and neopixels.

Some interesting parts of this project:
1) Wifi enabled and web pages to control stuff
2) auto net scan and connect or access point if no known network is found.
3) When in AP mode, you can select and configure the network from those found.
4) NTP time is used and you can set on and off times for the leds.
5) Neopixels are fun, my example has 56 of them!
